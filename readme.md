# DarkKiosk App for JIIT 62 Students

This app was build to manage and combine all info that a students need for day-to-day life jiit62 for example: webkiosk data, building timetable automatically from subjects retreived from webkiosk, editing timetable etc etc.

But as the scale and complexity of app grew, I was not able to update the app for public use and app is currently deprecated



### Prerequisites

This app relies on DarkKiosk API (https://github.com/tanishqmanuja/DarkKiosk-API-Public) for retreiving Webkiosk data.
